		<h2>Use of the Internet</h2>
		<p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">There are many useful ways to  use the Internet. The internet has introduced a new way of communication,  education, and social interaction. E-mailing and instant messaging are now part  of our everyday life. Looking for answers or definitions no more requires heavy  dictionaries; various search engines will find answers in milliseconds. The  latest news is available instantly without the need for a TV or newspaper. </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">In 2021 education has moved  online and it is easier than ever to find information and education materials  and tutorials.  </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">Online shopping is more popular than ever, mostly because high street shops are closed  during the pandemic. More and more local shops offer home delivery and online shopping. Most popular  online shops in Ireland are Littlewoods, Boohoo, Asos, Komplett and Amazon UK.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">Online banking and shopping  online have made shopping from home very accessible, especially in the middle  of a pandemic. Internet is changed how we pay bills and do our banking. I am  using online banking a lot and it gives great control, like managing my direct  debits and sending/receiving money. </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">Movies and music are distributed  mostly online for a fixed monthly subscription fee. The most popular video  streaming companies are <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>, <a href="http://www.primevideo.com/">Prime Video</a>, and <a href="http://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney Plus</a>. The most popular  music streaming services are <a href="http://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a>, <a href="http://www.music.apple.com/">Apple Music</a>, and <a href="http://www.tidal.com/">Tidal</a>. </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">Microsoft launched Xbox Game  Pass on 1 June 2017. (Humphries, 2021) It has grown in a very successful subscription  business model. It allows download games on Xbox game console, Personal  Computer or stream games to android mobile phone. (xbox.com, 2020)</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">Job searching has become easier  as most vacancies are advertised online. During the recent pandemic, many  employees are working from home.  As good  as it sounds working from home comes with the negative side of longer working  hours. The research by Laya Healthcare found that 65% of those working from  home feel pressure to stay connected after normal hours.  Employees worked an average of 22 hours of  overtime per month over the last year. Peoples mental health is suffering from  being always-on. (McHugh, 2021)</p>
