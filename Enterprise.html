		<h2>Customer Relations Management</h2>
	  <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company's interactions  with current and future customers. It often involves using technology to  organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and  technical support. A good CRM system gathers information from lots of sources  across the business and beyond.  The  business gets insights into how customers feel and what they are saying about  the business.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">Customer  relationship management (CRM) delivers a holistic view of each customer that  enables client-facing employees to make expedited and educated decisions about  strategic efforts in the sales, marketing, and customer service fields.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">CRM  software allows a business to create a connection with customers by automating  communications with them.  It gives  customers the feeling of personal service.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">Newer CRM systems integrate with social  media.  Social CRM allows for  communicating and connecting with customers in a medium that they are already  using.</p>

		<h2>Payments Systems</h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">There are more online payment options than ever before.  An online shop will offer as many as they can on their site. The  more online payment options the company offer, the more online sales will go  through, the more money company will make.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">Credit  cards are still the most popular way to pay for goods and  services online.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">The  most popular credit cards are: <strong>Mastercard, Visa, American Express, Discover.</strong> </p>

		<h2>Supply Chain Management</h2>
	  <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><strong>Supply chain management (SCM)</strong> is the management  of the flow of goods, data, and finances related to a product or service, from obtaining  raw materials to the delivery of the product.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">Logistics is just one part of the supply chain. Digitally  based SCM systems include material handling and software for all parties  involved in product or service creation, order fulfilment, and information  tracking―such as suppliers, manufacturers, wholesalers, transportation and  logistics providers, and retailers. </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">SCM has historically been about increasing  efficiency and reducing costs. Although those needs have not changed, what has  changed is that the customer is now playing a front-and-centre role in setting  SCM priorities. It has been said that customer experiences live and die in the  supply chain.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">Customer loyalty is predicated on an enterprise  being able to quickly and accurately fulfil customer expectations. Raw  materials, manufacturing, logistics, and trade, and order management must all  be coordinated to get a given item to the customer within a reasonable  timeframe. (Oracle, 2021)</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;">The reason why <strong>Amazon</strong> can have such a wide  spectrum of products is that they are not limited by physical space. Amazon do  not have actual stores. Amazon can currently ship close to 10 million different  products. This diversity makes a perfect example of what efficient supply chain  management can accomplish.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><strong>The Coca Cola Company</strong> products  are distributed to virtually every country in the world. Their preparation,  distribution and transportation logistics are in line with a segmentation  strategy for their customers when it comes to the size and presentation of  their products. </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%;"><strong>Colgate</strong> keeps  present all aspects of product diversity, effectiveness, optimization and  customer support and it uses an effective distribution channel that encompasses  all aspects of care and maintenance. (Kiger, n.d.)</p>
